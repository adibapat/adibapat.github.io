								<p style="font-size:12.5px"> Hello and welcome! I am a senior at the University of Michigan, and my journey at U-M has been an exciting blend of discovery and growth. Early on at the Ross School of Business, I immersed myself in a community of like-minded, driven individuals committed to sparking positive change. As an effective communicator, I learned that my passion lies in management. I am pursuing a BBA degree along with a CS minor, and I seek to find professional opportunities at the intersection of technology and business. Through team-based classes and personal projects, I have found great enjoyment working with both innovative software and business teams. This positions me well for roles in product management, financial analysis, and management consulting. I am eager to tackle real-world challenges, where collaboration, curiosity, and fun are at the heart of my approach. Aside from my professional interests, I enjoy music production, camping, and watching U-M football. Go Blue!

										<h2 class="major">GHJ Advisors</h2>
										<p> During my Summer 2024 rotational internship at GHJ, I gained meaningful experience in advisory, audit, and tax practices. With the guidance of private equity leaders and experienced public accountants, I had the opportunity to work with high-net-worth clients ranging from individuals to large conglomerates. This experience was invaluable in honing my analytical skills and providing a deeper understanding of financial processes and client management across various industries. The capstone presentation involved a strategic advisory initaive to expand GHJ's client base into the hospitality and aviation industries. I found enjoyment in leading my team through the process of creating an implementation roadmap, analyzing industry trends, and presenting actionable recommendations to C-suite.

										<h2 class="major">Ross Alumni Engagement</h2>
										<p>For my Summer 2023 internship, I worked with the Ross Alumni Engagement office to create a Young Alumni program for graduates 0-10 years out of college. Fully in charge of this project, I interviewed 50+ alumni around the world to gauge their experience with Alumni<i>Advantage</i> - our flagship alumni program. I conducted in-depth research on peer business institions to understand the differences between our respective programs. Most importantly, I collaborated with different teams across Ross, such as marketing, finance, and alumni relations, to brainstorm feasible solutions. Ultimately, I presented a 5-step plan of how the business school should approach building this program, which received high recognition and praise. </p>

										<h2 class="major">User Experience Design</h2>
										<p>I conducted a user experience research project to explore the need for a community feature on popular music streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and SoundCloud. This feature aims to enhance social interaction by allowing users to share, discuss, and discover music within a community setting. To determine the necessity and potential impact of this feature, I interviewed 10+ fellow U-M students who are active users of these services. I performed thematic analysis, including coding and creating themes from the interview data. I created an affinity diagram from the thematic analysis and concluded that adding a community feature would be a valuable enhancement for these music streaming platforms. This semester-long journey highlights the importance of user-centered design in identifying and addressing unmet needs in digital products.  </p>
